**Valdidation** - contains files for validation: irradiance maps and exported brdf-files as .txt

## TracePro simulation
The file BSDF_Projekt.OML contains a TracePro simulation. In this simulation, the grid-source is perpendicular to the sample. A detector screen is placed around the sample and the source. With this simulation, the scattering properties of the sample can be simulated. Furthermore, the provided macro Rotate_GridSource.scm can be used directly, so that a sample can be examined with regard to its scattering behavior.

**Note** The default number of rays from the source is 21421.
