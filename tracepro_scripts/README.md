## Trace Pro Script / Macro
**Requires** TracePro file containing a Grid-Source, Sample and optional a detector. The Grid-Source must be perpendicular to the sample and the rays must point to the sample.

**Returns** A series of .txt and .bmp files for irradiance data for specific angles. The Grid-Source is automatically rotated around the sample in 5Â° steps. Each file is called x_deg (x stays for specific angle).

**Note** Before using macro ensure the right number of traced rays. Check that the name of sample matches the name in macro and check that file path and folder are present.
