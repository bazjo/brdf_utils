# BRDF Utilities
Student Project by Johannes Frielingsdorf and Philipp Weber as part of the course "computer simulation in optics" at TH KÃ¶ln in the winter term 19/20.

## Goal
The main goal of the project is to generate TracePro surface property data out of data files at the custom build spectrum scattering goniometer.

## Structure
The structure of the repo is as follows. Work distribution is indicated by author initials in brackets.

* **documentation** - Functional and process documentation, as well as additional resources [JF/PW]
* **scilab_scripts** - Scripts for generating TracePro surface property files from goniometer measurements [JF/PW(Validation with TracePro)]
* **tracepro_scripts** - Script for generating irradiance maps for different incident elevations using TracePro macro language [PW]
* **tracepro_simulations** - TracePro evironmets for using the macro above and validating the generated surface property data
